===============================

##reallygoodbot Goals
* Improve bot detection, try not to reply to actual users.
* Perhaps only comment in hot threads as opposed to smaller/more intimate ones.

##Description

reallygoodbot compliments other bots.

## Current Subreddits

* [r/all](http://reddit.com/r/all)

## How to Clone and Run reallygoodbot
reallygoodbot was written to run in Python 3.4 and you will need the following package:
* PRAW (Reddit Python API)

To install these, first install Python 3.4, which comes with PIP. Then run the following command:
```
$ pip install praw

```

You will also need to edit the config.cfg file with your bots credentials. The code should now compile and run :)
